# Product Vision: [PRODUCT NAME]

**Created**: [DATE]
**Status**: Active | Evolving | Superseded
**Input**: Product concept: "$ARGUMENTS"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse product concept from Input
   → If empty: ERROR "No product description provided"
2. Extract key concepts: problem space, target users, value proposition
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Research Phase: Conduct strategic research
   → Market research: competitors, alternatives, market size
   → User research: target personas, pain points, workflows
   → Competitive analysis: differentiation opportunities
   → Document findings in this template
5. Define Problem Statement & Opportunity
   → If no clear problem: ERROR "Cannot determine problem being solved"
6. Create Target Users & Personas
   → At least 2-3 detailed personas required
7. Generate Product-Wide User Stories
   → Strategic level, not feature-specific
8. Create User Journey Maps (Mermaid diagrams - user perspective only)
9. Define Success Metrics & KPIs
   → Should be measurable and tied to business value
10. Document Product-Wide Non-Functional Requirements
    → Performance, security, scale, compliance constraints
11. Analyze Business Risks & Mitigation
12. VALIDATION GATE: Check for technical content
    → If system architecture found: ERROR "Remove technical architecture"
    → If API design found: ERROR "Remove API/implementation details"
    → If technology choices found: ERROR "Remove technology decisions"
    → Technical content belongs in /plan, not product vision
13. Return: SUCCESS (product vision ready for /specify)
```
