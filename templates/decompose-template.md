# Capability Decomposition: [FEATURE NAME]

**Parent Spec:** [link to parent spec.md]
**Decomposition Date:** [DATE]
**Target per Capability:** Reviewable PR size (can be reviewed in one session)

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load parent spec.md from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No parent specification found"
2. Extract functional requirements (FR-001, FR-002, ...)
   → If <3 requirements: WARN "Consider single capability"
3. Identify bounded contexts:
   → Group by: entity lifecycle, workflow stage, API clusters
   → Analyze dependencies between contexts
4. Estimate scope per capability:
   → Components: Models + Services + API/CLI
   → Tests: Contract + Integration coverage
   → Target: Reviewable PR (can be completed and reviewed efficiently)
5. Order capabilities:
   → By: infrastructure dependencies + business value
   → Mark foundation capabilities (no dependencies)
6. Validate decomposition:
   → Each capability: Reviewable PR size (small or medium)
   → No circular dependencies
   → All capabilities independently testable
   → Max 10 capabilities per parent feature
7. Generate capability directories and scoped specs
8. Return: SUCCESS (ready for /plan per capability)
```

## Decomposition Strategy

### Analysis Checklist
- [ ] Analyzed functional requirements (FR-001 to FR-XXX)
- [ ] Identified bounded contexts
- [ ] Estimated scope per capability
- [ ] Ordered by dependencies and business value
- [ ] Validated each capability is independently testable
- [ ] Confirmed no circular dependencies
- [ ] Verified total ≤10 capabilities

### Sizing Guidelines

**Capability Sizes:**
- **Small:** 1-2 components, focused scope, straightforward review
- **Medium:** 3-4 components, clear boundaries, manageable review
- **Large:** Consider further decomposition or merge with related capability

**Sizing Questions:**
- Can this capability be reviewed in one session?
- Is it independently testable and deployable?
- Does it deliver a coherent vertical slice?
- Are the boundaries clear with other capabilities?

## Capabilities

### Cap-001: [Capability Name]

**Size:** [Small | Medium]

**Scope:** [One sentence describing what this capability delivers]

**Dependencies:** [None (foundation) | Cap-XXX, Cap-YYY]

**Business Value:** [Why this capability matters, what it unblocks]

**Functional Requirements (from parent spec):**
- FR-XXX: [Requirement scoped to this capability]
- FR-YYY: [Requirement scoped to this capability]

**Components:**
- Models: [count] entities with validation
- Services: [count] operations
- API/CLI: [count] endpoints/commands
- Tests: Contract + integration coverage

**Capability Branch:** `[username]/[jira-key].[feature-name]-cap-001`
**PR Target:** `cap-001` branch → `main` (atomic PR)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] [Specific testable criterion for this capability]
- [ ] [Specific testable criterion for this capability]
- [ ] All tests pass (contract + integration)
- [ ] Code review approved
- [ ] Merged to main

---

### Cap-002: [Capability Name]

[Same structure as Cap-001]

---

### Cap-00X: [Capability Name]

[Repeat for each capability - target 3-8 capabilities per feature]

---

## Dependency Graph

```
Cap-001 [Foundation - no dependencies]
  ├── Cap-002 [Depends on: Cap-001]
  ├── Cap-003 [Depends on: Cap-001]
  │     └── Cap-005 [Depends on: Cap-003, Cap-004]
  └── Cap-004 [Depends on: Cap-001]
        └── Cap-005 [Depends on: Cap-003, Cap-004]

Cap-006 [Independent - no dependencies]
  └── Cap-007 [Depends on: Cap-006]
```

**Parallel Execution Opportunities:**
- **Wave 1:** Cap-001 (foundation)
- **Wave 2:** Cap-002, Cap-003, Cap-004 (all depend only on Cap-001)
- **Wave 3:** Cap-005 (depends on Cap-003 + Cap-004)
- **Parallel Track:** Cap-006 → Cap-007 (independent of main flow)

---

## Implementation Strategy

### Recommended Order

1. **Foundation First:** Cap-001 (blocks others, establishes base)
2. **Parallel Development:** Cap-002, Cap-003, Cap-004 (independent of each other)
3. **Integration:** Cap-005 (combines earlier capabilities)
4. **Polish:** Cap-006, Cap-007 (observability, tooling)

### Team Allocation (if applicable)

- **Dev 1:** Cap-001 → Cap-002 → Cap-005
- **Dev 2:** Cap-003 → Cap-006
- **Dev 3:** Cap-004 → Cap-007

### Timeline Estimate

- **Monolithic approach:** 1 PR × 7 days review = 7 days blocked
- **Capability approach:** [X] PRs × 1.5 days review = [Y] days total
- **With parallelization:** ~[Z] days (overlapping work on independent capabilities)

## Validation Checklist

### Decomposition Quality
- [ ] All capabilities: Reviewable PR size (small or medium)
- [ ] Each capability delivers independently testable value
- [ ] No circular dependencies in dependency graph
- [ ] Foundation capabilities identified (enable others)
- [ ] Parallel execution opportunities documented

### Capability Completeness
- [ ] Each capability has clear scope and boundaries
- [ ] All parent spec functional requirements distributed to capabilities
- [ ] No orphaned requirements (all FRs assigned to a capability)
- [ ] Each capability has measurable acceptance criteria
- [ ] Business value articulated for each capability

### Implementation Readiness
- [ ] Capability directories created (cap-001/, cap-002/, ...)
- [ ] Scoped spec.md generated in each capability directory
- [ ] Dependency graph validated (no cycles)
- [ ] Implementation order documented
- [ ] Team allocation considered (if multi-person)
