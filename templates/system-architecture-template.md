## Architecture Evolution

*Each feature that impacts architecture adds an entry here with semantic versioning.*

### Versioning Rules
- **Patch (v1.0.0 → v1.0.1)**: Bug fixes, clarifications, no architectural impact
- **Minor (v1.0.0 → v1.1.0)**: Additive changes - new components, services, or integrations
- **Major (v1.0.0 → v2.0.0)**: Breaking changes - structural refactors, technology replacements

## Architecture Constraints

*These constraints apply to ALL features unless explicitly justified and approved.*

### Database Constraints
- **Guideline**: Use PostgreSQL for persistent data
- **Exception Process**: New database types require architecture review
- **Rationale**: Maintain operational simplicity, team expertise

### Authentication Constraints
- **Guideline**: Use existing JWT authentication system
- **Exception Process**: New auth schemes require security review
- **Rationale**: Consistent security model, reduce attack surface

### API Constraints
- **Guideline**: REST endpoints following existing conventions
- **Exception Process**: GraphQL/gRPC require specific use case justification
- **Rationale**: API consistency, client compatibility

### Deployment Constraints
- **Guideline**: Deploy within existing Docker/container infrastructure
- **Exception Process**: New deployment models require operations review
- **Rationale**: Operational efficiency, monitoring consistency

### Language Constraints
- **Guideline**: [Primary language] for backend services
- **Exception Process**: New languages require architecture review
- **Rationale**: Team expertise, operational consistency

## Extension Guidelines

### When to ADD Components (Minor Version Bump)

**Appropriate for**:
- New storage type for specific feature need (object storage, cache, queue)
- New external service integration (payment gateway, email service)
- New infrastructure component (CDN, load balancer)
- New monitoring/observability tool

**Process**:
1. Document need in feature's `plan.md`
2. Justify why existing components insufficient
3. Update this file with new version entry
4. Ensure operations team can support new component

**Example**: "Adding Redis for real-time presence tracking (v1.1.0 → v1.2.0)"

### When to REFINE Architecture (Minor Version Bump)

**Appropriate for**:
- Performance optimizations that don't change structure
- Adding caching/optimization layers
- Enhancing existing components
- Backward-compatible improvements

**Process**:
1. Document refinement in feature's `plan.md`
2. Note which existing features benefit from refinement
3. Update this file with refinement details
4. Optional: Update affected features to use refinement

**Example**: "Adding Redis caching layer, existing features can optionally adopt"

### When to REFACTOR Architecture (Major Version Bump)

**Appropriate for**:
- Changing application structure (monolith ↔ microservices)
- Replacing core technology (database migration, language change)
- Changing deployment model (cloud provider, serverless)
- Introducing distributed systems patterns

**Process**:
1. **Architecture Review Required**: Propose refactor with detailed rationale
2. **Impact Assessment**: Document all affected features and migration effort
3. **Migration Plan**: Create detailed migration document
4. **Stakeholder Approval**: Business and technical leadership sign-off
5. **Phased Rollout**: Plan for incremental migration or feature flag approach
6. **Update this file**: Major version bump with full documentation

**Example**: "Splitting monolith into microservices to support independent scaling (v1.x → v2.0.0)"

## Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

*For significant architectural decisions, maintain lightweight ADRs*

### ADR Template
```markdown
### ADR-[Number]: [Decision Title]

**Status**: [Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded]
**Date**: [DATE]
**Context**: [What is the issue we're seeing that is motivating this decision?]
**Decision**: [What is the change that we're proposing/making?]
**Consequences**: [What becomes easier or more difficult as a result?]
```

### Example ADRs

#### ADR-001: Use PostgreSQL as Primary Database

**Status**: Accepted
**Date**: 2025-01-15
**Context**: Need to choose database for initial product launch
**Decision**: Use PostgreSQL for all persistent data storage
**Consequences**:
- Positive: Relational model fits our data, strong ACID guarantees, team expertise
- Negative: May need additional tools for specific use cases (caching, full-text search)
