# Capability Specification: [CAPABILITY NAME]

**Parent Feature:** [../spec.md](../spec.md)
**Capability ID:** Cap-XXX
**Size:** [Small | Medium] (targets reviewable PR)
**Dependencies:** [Cap-XXX, Cap-YYY | None]
**Created**: [DATE]
**Status**: Draft

<!-- Workspace Metadata (auto-populated in multi-repo workspaces) -->
**Workspace**: [WORKSPACE_NAME] (if workspace mode)
**Target Repository**: [REPO_NAME] (required for capabilities in multi-repo workspace)

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Verify parent spec exists at ../spec.md
   → If not found: ERROR "Parent spec required"
2. Extract scoped functional requirements from parent
   → Only requirements relevant to this capability
3. Define capability boundaries
   → What's IN scope for this capability
   → What's OUT of scope (handled by other capabilities)
4. Generate scoped user scenarios
   → Only scenarios this capability fulfills
5. Define acceptance criteria
   → Testable conditions for capability completion
6. Estimate component breakdown (qualitative sizing)
7. Fill Context Engineering for this capability
   → Research codebase patterns specific to this scope
   → Document libraries/gotchas relevant to this capability
8. Run Review Checklist
   → If scope seems too large for single PR: Consider further decomposition
9. Return: SUCCESS (ready for /plan --capability)
```

## ⚡ Capability Guidelines

- ✅ Focus on single bounded context (e.g., "User Auth", not "Entire User System")
- ✅ Independently testable and deployable
- ✅ Target reviewable PR size (can be reviewed in one session)
- ✅ Include adequate test coverage for the scope
- ❌ Avoid dependencies on uncompleted capabilities
- ❌ No cross-capability concerns (handle in separate capability)
